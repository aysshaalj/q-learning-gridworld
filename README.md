# Q-Learning Gridworld Agent

## Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using the Q-Learning algorithm to learn optimal actions in a Gridworld environment.

## Environment
- Discrete Gridworld
- States represent agent positions
- Actions include up, down, left, right
- Rewards defined for goal and penalty states

## Model
- Q-Learning (value-based reinforcement learning)
- ε-greedy exploration strategy
- Bellman update rule

## What I Implemented
- Q-table initialization and updates
- Exploration vs exploitation logic
- Training loop across multiple episodes
- Policy extraction and evaluation

## Tools
Python, NumPy

## How to Run
Open `QLearning.ipynb` in Colab or Jupyter and run all cells.
